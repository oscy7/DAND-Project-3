# # DAND-Project-3

## Third DAND Project - Analyze A/B Test Results

In this project, I worked on understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The objective was to understand if the company should implement a new page design.

## Summary 

* **Use Jupyter Notebook** to wrangle and work through a CSV file it see if the e-commerce company should implement a new web page design or keep the old page. 

* **PART I: Probability** Analyze the CSV file to understand proportions and liklihood of user conversion.

* **PART II: A/B Test** Establish Null and Alternative hypothesis and implement data collected from PART I to further understand if we can reject null hypothesis. 

* **PART III: A Regression Approach** Implement a regression model to understand that PART II can also be achieved by performing a regression.
